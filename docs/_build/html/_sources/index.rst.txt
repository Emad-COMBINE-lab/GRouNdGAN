   Overview of GRouNdGAN's architecture

This site serves as the documentation for the code released under the
**GRouNdGAN: GRN-guided simulation of single-cell RNA-seq data using causal generative adversarial networks** (GRouNdGAN) project. GRouNdGAN is a gene regulatory network (GRN)-guided causal implicit generative model for simulating single-cell RNA-seq data, in-silico perturbation experiments, and benchmarking GRN inference methods.


To find out more details about GRouNdGAN, you can check out our preprint on bioRxiv: \
