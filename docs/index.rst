   Overview of GRouNdGAN's architecture

This site serves as the documentation for the code released under the
**GRouNdGAN: GRN-guided simulation of single-cell RNA-seq data using causal generative adversarial networks** project. GRouNdGAN is a gene regulatory network (GRN)-guided causal implicit generative model for simulating single-cell RNA-seq data, in-silico perturbation experiments, and benchmarking GRN inference methods.
