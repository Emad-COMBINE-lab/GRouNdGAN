Welcome to GRouNdGAN's documentation!
=====================================  

This site documents the code released under **GRouNdGAN (GRN-guided simulation of single-cell RNA-seq data using causal generative adversarial networks)**. GRouNdGAN is a gene regulatory network (GRN)-guided causal implicit generative model for simulating single-cell RNA-seq data, in-silico perturbation experiments, and benchmarking GRN inference methods.
